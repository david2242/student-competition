# User Profile & Password Management - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding user profile management and password change functionality to the application.

## Backend Changes (Already Implemented)
- ✅ Added `POST /api/auth/change-password` endpoint
- ✅ Added `PUT /api/auth/profile` endpoint

## Frontend Implementation Plan

### 1. User Profile Management
- [ ] Create/Update Profile Form Component
    - Form fields: email, firstName, lastName
    - Form validation for email format
    - Show current values in the form
    - Add loading state during submission
    - Success/error notifications

### 2. Password Change Feature
- [ ] Create Password Change Form Component
    - Fields: currentPassword, newPassword, confirmNewPassword
    - Client-side validation:
        - New password strength requirements
        - Password confirmation match
        - Current password required
    - Show/hide password toggle
    - Loading state during submission
    - Success/error notifications

### 3. UI/UX
- [ ] Add new menu items/routes:
    - Profile Settings
    - Change Password
- [ ] Responsive design for forms
- [ ] Clear success/error messages
- [ ] Loading indicators

### 4. API Integration
- [ ] Create auth service methods:
    - `updateProfile(profileData)`
    - `changePassword(passwordData)`
- [ ] Error handling for API responses
- [ ] Token refresh handling if needed

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Manual testing:
    - Successful profile update
    - Successful password change
    - Error cases (invalid current password, weak password, etc.)
    - Form validations

### 6. Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Add user guide section for profile management
- [ ] Document password requirements

## Dependencies
- Frontend:
    - Angular Forms
    - Bootstrap (for form components)
    - RxJS for API calls

## Security Considerations
- Ensure all password fields are properly secured (type=password)
- Session management on password change
